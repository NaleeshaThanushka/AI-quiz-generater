The Solar System consists of the Sun and all the celestial objects bound to it by gravity. 
The eight planets in the Solar System are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. 
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, while Mercury is the smallest. 

The Sun is a star at the center of the Solar System. It provides heat and light, which are essential for life on Earth. 
Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths due to gravitational forces. 

Gravity is a force of attraction between two objects with mass. It keeps planets in orbit around the Sun and governs the motion of celestial bodies in space. 

The Moon is Earth's natural satellite and affects tides on our planet. Eclipses occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in specific ways. 

The study of the Solar System and celestial bodies is called Astronomy. Scientists use telescopes and space probes to explore planets, moons, and other objects in space.
